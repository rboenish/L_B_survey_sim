# L_B_survey_sim
Repository for a length-based fishery survey simulation project

This project is intended to create an open-source platform and/or model to simulate length-based fishery populations and evaluate candidate fishery-dependent survey approaches. 
Many fished invertebrate populations lack theoretical design and evaluation criteria for fishery-dependent surveys, often relying on simple data-limited approaches. With a general
lack of age data in copious datasets, we are trying to fill the void and create a tool for users with limited to copious length data can use. Users will be able to simulate
different population dynamics, including length-based spatial and temporal autocorrelation, simulate fishery behavior, and finally evaluate candidate sampling strategies. Outcomes
are meant to inform managers of the strength/ weaknesses in their current fishery-dependent survey programs, and to guide optimized use of limited monitoring resources.
Ultimately, this tool will enable managers to integrate aspects of their own data to evaluate their current monitoring protocols.
