# L_B_survey_sim
Repository for a length-based fishery survey simulation project

This project is intended to create an open-source platform to simulate length-based crustacean fishery populations and compare candidate fishery-dependent survey approaches. Many
fished crustacean populations lack theoretical design and evaluation criteria, often relying on length-only datasets and simple data-limited assessment approaches. Lack of robust
age information for these fisheries makes it difficult to mimic a managerâ€™s situation. We are trying to fill the void and create a tool for users with limited to copious length
data to use. Users will be able to simulate different population dynamics, including length-based spatial and temporal autocorrelation, fishery behavior, and evaluate candidate
sampling strategies. Outcomes are meant to inform managers of the strength/ weaknesses in their current fishery-dependent survey programs, and to guide optimized use of limited
monitoring resources. Ultimately, this tool will enable managers to integrate aspects of their own data to evaluate their current monitoring protocols.
